# Question or Truth - Online Multiplayer Card Game

## Game Overview
Question or Truth is a 2-player online deduction game that combines strategic card arrangement with a unique bidding and questioning system. Players must use their tokens wisely to either gather information through questions or make direct guesses about their opponent's card arrangement.

## Core Game Mechanics

### 1. Set Up Phase
- **Card Selection** ‚ö°Ô∏è
  - ‚úÖ Each player selects 8 cards from a standard deck (52-card matrix interface)
  - ‚úÖ Cards must be arranged in a specific order (rostrum implementation)
  - ‚úÖ Cards of the same suit must be arranged in ascending order (validation complete)
  - ‚úÖ Card values implemented (A=1, J=11, Q=12, K=13)

- **Initial Resources** üöß
  - ‚ùå Each player starts with 10 tokens (Not implemented)
  - ‚ùå Token system integration (Not implemented)

Status: Setup Phase is 60% complete. Missing token system implementation.

### 2. Bidding System
- **Bid Structure**
  - Each player starts with 10 tokens
  - Each round, players secretly submit tokens (0-10+ tokens)
  - 30-second timer for token submission
  - Higher bidder wins the right to act
  - Tie handling: If equal bids, dealer takes tokens, both players get +2 tokens, then rebid
  - Token management: Players get +2 tokens each round
  - Warning system: Red warning light when player has ‚â§5 tokens (visible to both players)

- **Token Management**
  - Tokens spent in bidding are lost regardless of outcome
  - Players must manage their token pool strategically
  - Running out of tokens limits available actions

### 3. Action Phase
- **Question Action**
  - Winner can ask one question about opponent's card arrangement
  - Question list I will provide later

- **Truth Action**
  - Guess opponent's 8-card arrangement (suits irrelevant, only values matter)
  - Incorrect guesses waste the action

### 4. Victory Conditions
- **Primary Win Condition**
  - First player to correctly identify all opponent's cards wins
  - Can be achieved through multiple successful Truth actions
  - If the player's guess is correct, it will end in victory for that player. if their guess is wrong, players shall submit tokens to begin a new round.
